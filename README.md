# MinUI-Collection-Generator-Simple-
a simple powershell script to create a game collections based off keywords

## Instructions
1. Drop CreateCollection.bat and CollectionGenV3.ps1 into root of SD card
2. Double Click Create Collection.bat
3. Enter the Name of your collection (Example: Sports )
4. Enter Keywords, seperated by commas (Example: Tennis,Baseball,Golf)
5. Review results and save to file, this will generate the appropriate text file and place it into collections folder(must already be created)

## Notes
Made this for my own personal use, and as such i havent done much extensive testing so use at your own risk(there shouldnt be any). Always back up your SD cards.
This is meant for smaller libraries, my testing was on about 15k files. All in the spirit of MinUI.
